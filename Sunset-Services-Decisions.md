# Sunset Services — Decisions log

Append-only log of project-level decisions made during the build of the Sunset Services website (v2). New entries go at the **bottom**; older entries are not edited or removed.

When to add an entry:

- A project capability is deferred to a later phase (or post-launch).
- A tool/integration is replaced or skipped versus the v2 plan.
- A non-obvious business decision is made that future contributors should know about.

## 2026-05-10 — ServiceM8 adoption deferred (Phase 2.01)

Sunset Services does not currently use ServiceM8 or any job-management software. Cowork did NOT create a ServiceM8 account in Phase 2.01.

**Treatment going forward:**

- Phase 2.13 (ServiceM8 webhook) ships the webhook endpoint behind `SERVICEM8_ENABLED=false`.
- Phase 2.17 (automation agent Part B) ships the on-demand portfolio-publish flow gated on the same flag.
- This is the same feature-flag pattern Mautic uses.
- If Erick adopts ServiceM8 post-launch, flip `SERVICEM8_ENABLED=true` and provide the API key — no code rework needed.

**Decided by:** user (Goran), in response to Phase 2.01 clarifying question.

## 2026-05-10 — Anthropic API account uses pre-existing email (Phase 2.01)

The Anthropic API account was NOT created at `dinovlazar2011@gmail.com` per spec. Instead, the user reused a pre-existing Anthropic account on a different (less-used) email to avoid losing existing billing setup and credits.

**Mitigation declined:** Neither email-change nor forwarding-to-`dinovlazar2011@gmail.com` was set up. User will rely on manually checking the Anthropic inbox.

**Risk acknowledged:** Anthropic billing-threshold notifications ($20 cap alerts) and security alerts (unusual usage, new API keys, etc.) go to an inbox that is not actively monitored. If the chat widget or automation agent ever stops working unexpectedly, the first diagnostic step is to check that inbox for Anthropic emails.

**Mitigation if this becomes a real problem post-launch:** Anthropic Console → Settings → Account → change the account email to `info@sunsetservices.us` (or `dinovlazar2011@gmail.com` for Part 2 dev). Takes 5 minutes; preserves the account, billing, and credits.

**Decided by:** user (Goran), in response to Phase 2.01 Step 5 clarifying question.

## 2026-05-10 — Step 7 (GCP + Places API + GBP API application) moved to new Phase 2.13.2

The entire Phase 2.01 Step 7 (Google Cloud Platform project, Places API, GBP API access application) was deferred out of Phase 2.01 and into a new Phase 2.13.2 that will run just before Phase 2.14 in Part 2.

**What Step 7 originally covered:**

- 7A. Create GCP project, enable billing, enable Places API, create restricted API key, smoke-test against Sunset Services' real Aurora, IL listing, capture `place_id`.
- 7B. Confirm Erick has manager/owner access to the Sunset Services Google Business Profile. If not, fork to a postcard-verification claim-and-verify path (~5 business days).
- 7C. Submit the GBP API access application at `https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/basic-setup`. Starts a 2–6 week Google review clock.

**Downstream impact:**

- **Phase 2.14** (write to Google Business Profile — posts, photos, replies) waits on Phase 2.13.2's GBP API approval. Phase 2.14 effectively runs 2–6 weeks after Phase 2.13.2 begins.
- **Phase 2.16** (daily reviews fetched via Places API and shown on the site) waits on Phase 2.13.2's Places API key.
- **Phase 2.17** (automation agent Part B — on-demand portfolio publishing) loses the Google publish leg until 2.13.2 + 2.14 complete. The Telegram approval leg is unaffected.

**Why deferred:**

User decision after weighing implications. Trade-off: clean Phase 2.01 finish vs. ~4–6 calendar weeks of cumulative slippage on downstream Part 2 phases that depend on Google Cloud.

**Action required before Phase 2.13.2:**

- Confirm Erick's GBP listing is verified to him (test: `business.google.com` shows Sunset Services in his profile list). If not, start postcard verification immediately — that's a ~5-business-day pre-step that doesn't have to wait on 2.13.2 itself.

**Decided by:** user (Goran), in response to Phase 2.01 Step 7 clarifying question.
